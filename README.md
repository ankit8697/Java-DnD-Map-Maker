## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project allows users to generate a map on a grid using different coloured tiles to indicate different kinds of terrain, as well as place players on the map and show distances that they could potentially move to. It includes ways to deal with three-dimensional battles, and display any area effects players or monsters may create.

The project follows SOLID design principles and uses common design patterns like MVC, Observer Pattern, and Strategy Pattern.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

This application has a lot of uses when playing D&D as it takes away the hassle of calculating distances when players are flying or underground, and makes it easy to check if a specific enemy or player will be targeted by an effect that takes the shape of a 3D object such as a sphere or cylinder.
